## `POST /api/account/transfer`

Builds an unsigned transaction that transfers tokens from a Silkysig account to a recipient. When signed by an operator, the transaction is subject to on-chain policy enforcement.

### Request Body

<ParamField body="signer" type="string" required>
  Signer's Solana wallet address. Must be the account owner or a registered operator.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="accountPda" type="string" required>
  The Silkysig account PDA to send from.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="recipient" type="string" required>
  Recipient's Solana wallet address.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="amount" type="number" required>
  Amount in tokens (e.g., `5` for 5 USDC).
</ParamField>

### Response

<ResponseField name="transaction" type="string">
  Base64-encoded unsigned Solana transaction.
</ResponseField>

### Example

```bash
curl -X POST https://silk.silkyway.ai/api/account/transfer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "signer": "Ax7kQ9bR3mFVDg2Thh3AG6sFRPqNrDJ4",
    "accountPda": "9aE5kBqR3mFVDg2Thh3AG6sFRPqNrDJ4",
    "recipient": "7xKXzM8q4bR3nFVDg2Thh3AG6sFRPqNr",
    "amount": 5
  }'
```

```json
{
  "transaction": "base64-encoded-unsigned-transaction..."
}
```

### Policy Enforcement

When the signer is an **operator** (not the owner), the Silkysig program enforces:

1. **Per-transaction limit** — amount must not exceed the operator's `perTxLimit`
2. **Daily limit** — cumulative daily spending must not exceed `dailyLimit`
3. **Account status** — account must not be paused

If any check fails, the transaction is **rejected on-chain**.

When the signer is the **owner**, all policy checks are bypassed. The owner has unrestricted access.

### Errors

| Code | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| `POLICY_EXCEEDS_TX_LIMIT` | Amount exceeds operator's per-transaction limit |
| `POLICY_EXCEEDS_DAILY_LIMIT` | Daily spending limit reached |
| `POLICY_UNAUTHORIZED` | Signer is not an owner or operator |
| `ACCOUNT_PAUSED` | Account is temporarily disabled |
| `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` | Not enough tokens in the account |
