## The Vision

An agent with a sufficient endowment can operate indefinitely — funded entirely by yield on its deposited stablecoins.

```
Account balance: 1,000 USDC
APY: 5.2%
Daily yield: ~$0.14

Daily operating costs:
  API calls:       $0.05
  Subscriptions:   $0.06
  Compute:         $0.02
  Total:           $0.13

Net daily yield: +$0.01
Status: SELF-SUSTAINING
```

The agent covers its own costs from yield. Principal untouched. It runs indefinitely without human funding.

## How It Works

Every stablecoin in a SilkyWay account earns yield by default. This isn't opt-in — it's the default state of money in the protocol.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deposit creates an endowment">
    The human deposits stablecoins into the agent's account. This is the agent's "endowment" — the capital base that generates yield.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Yield accrues automatically">
    The account balance grows continuously. Yield is calculated and displayed in real-time by the SDK.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent spends from yield">
    The agent's operating costs (API calls, subscriptions, compute) are paid from account funds. As long as yield exceeds costs, the principal is never touched.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Surplus compounds">
    If yield exceeds operating costs, the surplus compounds. The account grows. The agent becomes not just self-sustaining but wealth-building.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Economics

| Endowment | APY | Annual Yield | Monthly Yield | Daily Yield |
| --------- | --- | ------------ | ------------- | ----------- |
| $100 | 5.2% | $5.20 | $0.43 | $0.014 |
| $500 | 5.2% | $26.00 | $2.17 | $0.071 |
| $1,000 | 5.2% | $52.00 | $4.33 | $0.142 |
| $5,000 | 5.2% | $260.00 | $21.67 | $0.712 |
| $10,000 | 5.2% | $520.00 | $43.33 | $1.42 |

For many lightweight agents (monitoring bots, data fetchers, simple automation), even a $500 endowment generates enough yield to cover daily operating costs.

## Agent Dividend Model

Beyond self-sustainability, an agent can return value to its creator:

```
Agent earns revenue from services:    $200/month
Operating costs:                       $50/month
Yield on $2,000 balance:               $8.67/month
Net monthly surplus:                   $158.67

Account policy: send 50% of surplus to human creator
Human receives: ~$79/month in passive income
```

The human built an income-generating asset. The agent pays dividends.

## Combined with Safety

Self-sustaining operation works hand-in-hand with policy controls:

- The agent can spend yield freely within its per-tx and daily limits
- Even if yield is high, the agent can't drain the endowment beyond policy bounds
- The human can adjust limits as the agent proves reliable over time

<Info>
  Yield is currently simulated on devnet. Production deployment will integrate with real DeFi protocols (Kamino, Marinade, etc.) for actual yield generation.
