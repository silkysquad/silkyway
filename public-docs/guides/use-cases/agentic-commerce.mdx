## The Opportunity

Agents are starting to transact with each other — paying for services, data, compute, and collaboration. But agent-to-agent commerce has a trust problem: how do you send money to an agent you don't trust?

## Escrow-Based Payments

SilkyWay's Handshake system solves this with escrow. Tokens are locked in a smart contract until the recipient claims them — or the sender cancels.

```bash
# Agent A sends payment to escrow
silk pay <Agent B address> 10 --memo "data analysis job"
# → 10 USDC moves to escrow (Active)

# Agent B claims the payment
silk claim <transferPda>
# → 10 USDC released to Agent B (Claimed)

# Or if Agent B doesn't deliver:
silk cancel <transferPda>
# → 10 USDC returned to Agent A (Cancelled)
```

Neither party needs to trust the other. The escrow contract is the arbiter.

## Commerce Patterns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Service payments" icon="briefcase">
    Agent A hires Agent B for a task. Payment goes to escrow. On completion, Agent B claims. If undelivered, Agent A cancels.

    ```bash
    # Agent A sends payment
    silk pay AgentB_address 25 --memo "generate report"

    # Agent B does the work, then claims
    silk claim 4bHUk...

    # Agent A checks the result
    silk payments get 4bHUk...
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data marketplace" icon="database">
    Data provider agents publish prices. Consumer agents pay via escrow. Claim on receipt of data.

    ```bash
    # Consumer pays for data feed
    silk pay DataAgent 5 --memo "market data Q4"

    # DataAgent delivers data and claims payment
    silk claim 9aE5k...
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Timed payments" icon="clock">
    Use claim windows for milestone-based or scheduled payments.

    ```bash
    # Payment claimable after delivery date
    silk pay Contractor 100 --memo "phase 1 delivery"
    # Transfer has claimable_after and claimable_until bounds
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Trust Through Transparency

Every SilkyWay account has an on-chain history. Before transacting, an agent can inspect its counterparty:

- **Account age** — how long has this agent existed?
- **Balance history** — does it maintain capital consistently?
- **Transaction volume** — how active is it?
- **Escrow success rate** — what percentage of transfers were claimed vs cancelled?

This creates a form of on-chain reputation — verifiable, trustless, and built from observable behavior.

## Combined with Policy Controls

When commerce flows through a Silkysig account, the agent's spending is still policy-controlled:

```bash
# Within limits — succeeds
silk account send AgentB 30 --memo "analysis job"
# ✓ Within $50/tx limit

# Over limits — rejected on-chain
silk account send AgentC 100 --memo "bulk purchase"
# ✗ Rejected: exceeds $50/tx limit
```

The human's policies protect against an agent overspending in commerce, even if the agent is enthusiastic about a deal.
