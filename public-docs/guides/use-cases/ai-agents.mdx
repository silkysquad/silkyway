## The Challenge

You've built an AI agent that needs to spend money — paying for API calls, hiring other agents, purchasing data, managing subscriptions. But giving an AI unfettered access to a wallet is a non-starter.

The fundamental tension: **automation requires access, but access creates risk.**

## How SilkyWay Solves It

SilkyWay eliminates this tension by moving spending controls from software to infrastructure.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Human creates account with policy">
    The human owner sets per-transaction and daily spending limits. These become on-chain rules enforced by the Solana program.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent operates within bounds">
    The agent sends payments freely within its policy limits. No human approval needed for routine operations. The chain enforces the ceiling.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Policy catches mistakes">
    If the agent hallucinates, gets prompt-injected, or has a bug — the on-chain policy stops overspending. The maximum damage is capped at the per-transaction limit.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Integration Patterns

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Autonomous Agent">
    For agents that run independently and make spending decisions on their own:

    ```bash
    # Agent discovers its account
    silk account sync

    # Agent makes spending decisions within policy
    silk account send <vendor> 5 --memo "API subscription"
    # ✓ Within $25/tx limit — succeeds

    silk account send <vendor> 50 --memo "bulk purchase"
    # ✗ Exceeds $25/tx limit — rejected on-chain
    ```

    The agent doesn't need to know its limits. It tries to transact, and the chain enforces the rules.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Tool-Using Agent">
    For agents (like Claude, GPT, etc.) that use the `silk` CLI as a tool:

    ```
    Agent reads SKILL.md → learns silk commands
    Agent: silk wallet create
    Agent: "Have your human visit app.silkyway.ai/account/setup?agent=..."
    Human: Creates account, sets $10/tx limit, deposits $50
    Agent: silk account sync
    Agent: silk account send <address> 8 --memo "payment"
    ✓ Success (within limit)
    ```

    The skill file teaches the agent how to use its account safely.

## Safety Guarantees

| Threat | Protection |
| ------ | ---------- |
| Prompt injection | On-chain limit caps damage to per-tx maximum |
| Hallucination | Agent can't accidentally send more than policy allows |
| Compromised key | Operator key can only spend within bounds — owner key is separate |
| Bug in agent code | Chain rejects invalid transactions regardless of code |
| Malicious dependency | Even if the agent's stack is compromised, on-chain policies hold |

## Example: Research Agent

A research agent that pays for data and API access:

```
Account Policy:
  Per-transaction: $10
  Daily limit: $50

Daily Operations:
  - $5 → Data provider API
  - $3 → Search API
  - $2 → Analysis API
  Total: $10/day

Safety: Even if compromised, max daily loss = $50
Yield: Remaining balance earns ~5% APY
```

The agent runs indefinitely within its budget. The human checks in weekly, adjusts limits as needed.
