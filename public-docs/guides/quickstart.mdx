This guide walks through the complete flow: create a wallet, set up a policy-controlled account, fund it, and make your first payment.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A Solana wallet (Phantom, Solflare) for the human owner

## Step 1: Install the SDK

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install -g @silkyway/sdk
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add @silkyway/sdk
```
</CodeGroup>

Verify the installation:

```bash
silk --version
```

## Step 2: Create an Agent Wallet

```bash
silk wallet create my-agent
```

```
Wallet created: Ax7kQ9bR3mFVDg2Thh3AG6sFRPqNrDJ4
Stored at: ~/.config/silk/config.json
```

This generates a Solana keypair and stores it locally. This wallet will become the agent's operator key on the account.

## Step 3: Fund the Wallet (Devnet)

```bash
silk wallet fund --sol --usdc
```

```
✓ 2 SOL airdropped (for transaction fees)
✓ 100 USDC minted (devnet faucet)
```

<Info>
  The faucet is devnet-only and rate-limited to one request per 10 minutes per wallet.
</Info>

## Step 4: Set Up an Account (Human Side)

The human owner creates the policy-controlled account. Have them visit:

```
https://silk.silkyway.ai/account/setup?agent=YOUR_AGENT_ADDRESS
```

On this page, the human will:
1. Connect their Solana wallet (becomes the account owner)
2. Set a per-transaction spending limit for the agent
3. Sign the account creation transaction
4. Deposit stablecoins into the account

## Step 5: Sync the Account

Once the human has created and funded the account:

```bash
silk account sync
```

```
✓ Account found: 9aE5kBqR...
  Owner: 7xKXz... (human)
  Operator: Ax7kQ9... (you)
  Balance: 5.0001 USDC (+$0.0001 yield)
  Policy: max $5.00 per transaction
```

The SDK discovers the account by looking up your wallet address as an operator. Account info is stored in your local config.

## Step 6: Check Account Status

```bash
silk account status
```

```
Account: 9aE5kBqR...
Owner: 7xKXz...
Balance: 5.0002 USDC (+$0.0002 yield)
APY: 5.2%
Policy: max $5.00/tx
```

Notice the balance has already grown slightly from yield.

## Step 7: Make a Payment

Try sending an amount within your policy limits:

```bash
silk account send 7xKXz... 3 --memo "first payment"
```

```
✓ 3 USDC sent to 7xKXz...
  Transaction: 5UfDuXsr...
```

Now try exceeding your limit:

```bash
silk account send 7xKXz... 10 --memo "too much"
```

```
✗ REJECTED by on-chain program: amount $10.00 exceeds per-transaction limit of $5.00.
  Policy enforcement is on-chain — your funds are protected at the protocol level.
```

The chain rejected the transaction. Not your code. Not an API. The Solana program itself.

## What Just Happened

1. You created an agent wallet (operator key)
2. A human created a policy-controlled account with your wallet as operator
3. The human set a $5 per-transaction limit
4. You operated within the account — the chain enforced the policy
5. The account earned yield on the deposited stablecoins

The human stays in control (owner). The agent operates within bounds (operator). The chain enforces everything (program).
