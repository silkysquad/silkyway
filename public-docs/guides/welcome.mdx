## The Problem

Every agent wallet solution today gives the agent a raw keypair. Full control. No structure. This creates two unsolved problems:

**Too much power.** The agent can drain the entire wallet at any time. One hallucination, one prompt injection, one bad API call — funds gone. Current solutions are all trust-based: human-in-the-loop approvals (defeats automation), rate limits in agent code (not enforceable), custodial APIs (trust the custodian).

**Too little structure.** A wallet has no concept of budgets, schedules, permissions, or policies. It's a signing key with a balance. Asking an agent to manage money with a wallet is like giving an employee a personal checking account and calling it a company budget.

## The Thesis

**Agents don't need wallets. They need accounts.**

A SilkyWay account is an on-chain program (PDA on Solana) that holds funds, enforces policies, and enables programmable financial workflows — all without trusting the agent, the human, or any third party.

## Core Principles

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Safety Through Infrastructure" icon="shield">
    Spending policies are enforced on-chain by the Solana program. Not in agent code. Not in an API layer. A prompt injection can't bypass what the chain itself enforces.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Human in the Kernel" icon="user-shield">
    The human (owner) sets policies and maintains full control. The agent (operator) runs in "user space" within granted permissions. The Solana program is the kernel.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Yield by Default" icon="chart-line">
    Every stablecoin in a SilkyWay account earns yield automatically. Idle capital is working capital. Agents can self-sustain from returns alone.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Programmable Accounts" icon="gear">
    Accounts support multiple operators, each with independent policies. Subscriptions, payroll, revenue splits — the account handles the financial workflow.

## The Account Model

A SilkyWay account is not a keypair. It's a programmable, policy-controlled financial primitive:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SilkyWay Account (on-chain PDA)                │
│                                                 │
│  Owner (human):  full control                   │
│  Operators (up to 3, each with own policy):     │
│    ├── AI Agent     → max $100/tx, $500/day     │
│    ├── Yield Service → yield-only operations    │
│    └── Payroll Bot  → $150/month to approved    │
│                                                 │
│  Token Balances (up to 4 SPL tokens):           │
│    ├── USDC:  800 (earning yield)               │
│    ├── USDT:  150 (earning yield)               │
│    └── PYUSD:  50 (earning yield)               │
│                                                 │
│  Policies enforced on-chain per operator.       │
│  No trust required.                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Owner + Operator Model

| Role | Capabilities |
| ---- | ------------ |
| **Owner** (human) | Full control. Add/remove operators. Change policies. Withdraw without limits. The "root" key. |
| **Operator** (agent) | Spend within policy bounds. Per-transaction and daily limits. Cannot modify its own policies. |

Each operator slot has independent `per_tx_limit` and `daily_limit`. The program checks *which operator is signing* and applies *that operator's specific policy*.

## How It's Different

| Approach | Safety | Automation | On-Chain |
| -------- | ------ | ---------- | -------- |
| Raw wallet (keypair) | None | Full | Yes |
| Human-in-the-loop | High | None | N/A |
| Custodial API | Trust-based | Full | No |
| Rate limits in agent code | Bypassable | Full | No |
| **SilkyWay account** | **On-chain enforced** | **Full** | **Yes** |

<Info>
  SilkyWay reframes agent financial safety as an **infrastructure problem**, not an AI alignment problem. You don't need to make the agent smarter or more careful. You make the account's policies physically unbreakable at the Solana program level.
