## Account Concepts

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| **SilkyWay Account** | An on-chain program (PDA) that holds funds, enforces spending policies, and supports multiple operators. One account per human owner. |
| **Owner** | The human who created the account. Has full control — can add/remove operators, change policies, withdraw without limits. The "root" key. |
| **Operator** | A key (typically an agent) with policy-bound permissions on an account. Can spend within limits but cannot change its own policies. Up to 3 per account. |
| **Operator Slot** | One of 3 policy slots per account. Each slot has its own `per_tx_limit`, `daily_limit`, and spend tracking. |
| **Per-Transaction Limit** | Maximum amount an operator can spend in a single transaction. Enforced on-chain by the Silkysig program. |
| **Daily Limit** | Maximum amount an operator can spend per day. Tracked on-chain, resets every 24 hours. |
| **Account PDA** | Program Derived Address — the on-chain address of a SilkyWay account. Derived from `["account", owner_pubkey]`. |
| **Token Slot** | One of 4 slots per account for holding different SPL tokens. Lazy-initialized on first deposit of each token type. |

## Payment Concepts

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| **Transfer** | An escrow-based payment through the Handshake program. Tokens move to escrow, recipient claims. |
| **Transfer PDA** | The on-chain address of a specific escrow transfer. Derived from sender, recipient, nonce, and pool. |
| **Escrow** | Tokens held in a pool between transfer creation and claim/cancel. Secured by the Handshake program. |
| **Pool** | A Handshake escrow pool for a specific token mint. Operated by a designated pool operator. |
| **Claim** | The recipient taking ownership of escrowed tokens. Moves tokens from pool to recipient. |
| **Cancel** | The sender reclaiming escrowed tokens before the recipient claims. Returns tokens to sender. |
| **Claim Window** | Optional time bounds on a transfer — `claimable_after` (earliest claim time) and `claimable_until` (deadline). |
| **Memo** | An optional text message attached to a transfer. |

## Technical Concepts

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| **PDA** | Program Derived Address — a Solana account address derived deterministically from seeds. Not a keypair. Controlled by the program. |
| **ATA** | Associated Token Account — a Solana account that holds a specific SPL token for a specific owner. |
| **SPL Token** | Solana's token standard. USDC, USDT, PYUSD are all SPL tokens. |
| **Anchor** | The Solana development framework used to build SilkyWay's on-chain programs. |
| **Instruction** | A single operation submitted to a Solana program. `create_account`, `deposit`, `transfer_from_account` are all instructions. |

## Financial Concepts

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| **Yield** | Returns earned on stablecoin deposits. Displayed as APY (Annual Percentage Yield). |
| **APY** | Annual Percentage Yield — the annualized rate of return including compounding. |
| **Self-Sustaining Agent** | An agent whose yield earnings cover its operating costs, allowing indefinite operation without additional funding. |

## Status Values

### Transfer Status

| Status | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| `Active` | Tokens in escrow, waiting for claim |
| `Claimed` | Recipient successfully claimed |
| `Cancelled` | Sender cancelled before claim |
| `Rejected` | Pool operator rejected |
| `Declined` | Recipient declined |
| `Expired` | Claim window passed |

### Error Codes

| Code | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| `POLICY_EXCEEDS_TX_LIMIT` | Transaction amount exceeds operator's per-tx limit |
| `POLICY_EXCEEDS_DAILY_LIMIT` | Daily spending limit reached |
| `POLICY_UNAUTHORIZED` | Signer is not an owner or operator on this account |
| `ACCOUNT_PAUSED` | Account operations are temporarily disabled |
| `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` | Not enough tokens in the account |
