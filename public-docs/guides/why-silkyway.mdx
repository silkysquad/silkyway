## The Agent Economy Needs Infrastructure

Autonomous agents are becoming economic participants — paying for APIs, hiring other agents, managing subscriptions, earning revenue. But the financial tools available to them are primitive.

Giving an agent a wallet keypair is the equivalent of handing an employee an envelope of cash. It works, technically. But there are no controls, no structure, no safety nets, and no financial identity.

## The Wallet Problem

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No spending controls" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    A wallet keypair has no concept of limits. An agent with access to a private key can drain the entire balance in a single transaction. One hallucination, one prompt injection, one compromised dependency — funds gone.

    Current mitigations are all trust-based:
    - **Human-in-the-loop**: Defeats the purpose of automation
    - **Rate limits in agent code**: Not enforceable — the agent can be modified or bypassed
    - **Custodial APIs**: You're trusting a third party with your funds
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No financial identity" icon="id-card">
    A wallet is just a keypair. It has no history, no reputation, no verifiable track record. When Agent A wants to do business with Agent B, there's no way to assess trustworthiness from the wallet alone.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Dead capital" icon="piggy-bank">
    Stablecoins sitting in a wallet earn nothing. Agent working capital is idle capital. For agents running 24/7, this is a significant opportunity cost.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No structure" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Wallets don't support budgets, schedules, multi-party permissions, or financial workflows. Every payment is a raw transaction. There's no concept of "this operator can spend $X but not more."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## The Silkyway Solution

Silkyway replaces wallets with **policy-controlled accounts** — on-chain programs that enforce spending rules at the protocol level.

| Feature | Wallets | Silkyway Accounts |
| ------- | ------- | ----------------- |
| Spending limits | None | Per-tx and daily limits, on-chain enforced |
| Multi-party access | Single key | Owner + up to 3 operators, each with independent policies |
| Yield | None | Automatic yield on all stablecoin balances |
| Financial identity | Address only | On-chain history, transaction volume, escrow success rate |
| Policy enforcement | Trust-based | Solana program rejects invalid transactions |
| Token support | Single | Up to 4 SPL tokens per account |

## Who It's For

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Agent Developers" icon="robot">
    Give your agents safe access to funds. Set per-transaction limits, daily caps, and let the chain enforce them. Ship autonomous agents without worrying about catastrophic financial failures.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agent Operators" icon="user">
    Fund agent accounts with confidence. Set policies once, then trust the protocol — not the agent. Monitor balances and adjust limits as needed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agent Platforms" icon="building">
    Integrate Silkyway accounts as the financial layer for your agent platform. Standardized payment infrastructure with built-in safety.

  <Card title="Agent-to-Agent Commerce" icon="handshake">
    Enable secure transactions between agents through escrow. Verifiable counterparty trust based on on-chain account history.

## The Guardrails Breakthrough

This is the key insight: **agent financial safety is an infrastructure problem, not an AI alignment problem.**

```
Agent: "I want to send $10,000 to some random address"
Account: Transaction rejected. Operator #1 limit: $100/tx.
```

The program looks up the signing operator's policy and rejects the transaction. Not the agent's code. Not an API layer. Not a human reviewer. The chain itself.

Implications:
- Prompt injection can't drain funds beyond policy limits
- Hallucinating agents can't make catastrophic financial decisions
- Compromised agent keys are damage-limited by policy
- Humans set policies once, then trust the chain — not the agent
- Third parties can verify policies on-chain before interacting
