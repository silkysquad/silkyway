## Overview

The `silk account` commands interact with Silkysig accounts — policy-controlled, on-chain accounts created by a human owner. Your wallet must be registered as an operator on the account.

## Commands

### `silk account sync`

Discover and sync your Silkysig account by looking up your wallet as an operator.

```bash
silk account sync [--wallet <label>] [--account <pda>]
```

| Flag | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `--wallet <label>` | Specify which wallet to use for discovery |
| `--account <pda>` | Sync directly by account PDA address (skips operator lookup) |

```bash
silk account sync
```

```
✓ Account found: 9aE5kBqR...
  Owner: 7xKXz... (human)
  Operator: Ax7kQ9... (you)
  Balance: 50.0012 USDC (+$0.0012 yield)
  Policy: max $10.00 per transaction
```

The SDK stores the account PDA and operator details in your local config. Future account commands use this cached info.

<Info>
  Run `silk account sync` after the human creates your account. The SDK discovers the account by querying the backend for accounts where your wallet is an operator.
</Info>

### `silk account status`

Display current account state — balance, yield, policy, and operator info.

```bash
silk account status [--wallet <label>]
```

```bash
silk account status
```

```
Account: 9aE5kBqR...
Owner: 7xKXz...
Balance: 50.0024 USDC (+$0.0024 yield)
APY: 5.2%
Policy: max $10.00/tx
```

---

### `silk account send`

Send tokens from the Silkysig account to a recipient. Subject to on-chain policy enforcement.

```bash
silk account send <recipient> <amount> [--memo <text>] [--wallet <label>]
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `recipient` | Yes | Solana address of the recipient |
| `amount` | Yes | Amount in tokens (e.g., `5` for 5 USDC) |
| `--memo <text>` | No | Optional memo attached to the transfer |
| `--wallet <label>` | No | Specify which operator wallet to use |

**Successful transfer:**

```bash
silk account send 7xKXz... 5 --memo "API payment"
```

```
✓ 5 USDC sent to 7xKXz...
  Transaction: 5UfDuXsr...
```

**Policy rejection:**

```bash
silk account send 7xKXz... 25 --memo "too much"
```

```
✗ REJECTED: amount $25.00 exceeds per-transaction limit of $10.00
  Policy enforcement is on-chain — your funds are protected at the protocol level.
```

<Warning>
  Policy enforcement happens on-chain. If the amount exceeds your operator's per-transaction limit, the Solana program itself rejects the transaction. This cannot be bypassed.
</Warning>

## Account Setup Flow

Before you can use account commands, a human owner must create the account:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Agent creates wallet">
    ```bash
    silk wallet create my-agent
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Human creates account">
    The human visits `silk.silkyway.ai/account/setup?agent=WALLET_ADDRESS`, connects their wallet, sets spending limits, and deposits funds.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent syncs">
    ```bash
    silk account sync
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent operates">
    ```bash
    silk account send <recipient> <amount>
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
