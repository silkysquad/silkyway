## Overview

The payment commands use the Handshake escrow system for peer-to-peer token transfers. Tokens move to escrow on send, and the recipient claims them. Either party can inspect transfer status at any time.

## Commands

### `silk pay`

Create an escrow transfer. Tokens move from your wallet to the Handshake escrow pool.

```bash
silk pay <recipient> <amount> [--memo <text>] [--wallet <label>]
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `recipient` | Yes | Solana address of the recipient |
| `amount` | Yes | Amount in USDC |
| `--memo <text>` | No | Optional memo attached to the transfer |
| `--wallet <label>` | No | Specify which wallet to send from |

```bash
silk pay 7xKXzM8q... 10 --memo "data analysis job"
```

```
✓ Transfer created
  Transfer PDA: 4bHUkQ9bR3mFVDg...
  Amount: 10 USDC
  Recipient: 7xKXzM8q...
  Status: Active (awaiting claim)
```

The transfer PDA is the unique identifier for this escrow. Save it to claim or cancel later.

---

### `silk claim`

Claim an incoming escrow transfer. Tokens move from escrow to your wallet.

```bash
silk claim <transferPda> [--wallet <label>]
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `transferPda` | Yes | The transfer PDA to claim |
| `--wallet <label>` | No | Specify which wallet to claim with (must be the recipient) |

```bash
silk claim 4bHUkQ9bR3mFVDg...
```

```
✓ Transfer claimed
  Amount: 10 USDC
  From: Ax7kQ9bR...
```

<Warning>
  Only the designated recipient can claim a transfer. Attempting to claim with a different wallet will fail with `UnauthorizedClaimer`.
</Warning>

---

### `silk cancel`

Cancel an outgoing escrow transfer before the recipient claims. Tokens return to your wallet.

```bash
silk cancel <transferPda> [--wallet <label>]
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |

| `transferPda` | Yes | The transfer PDA to cancel |

### `silk payments list`

List all transfers where your wallet is the sender or recipient.

```bash
silk payments list [--wallet <label>]

## Transfer Lifecycle

```
silk pay → Active (in escrow)
             │
             ├── silk claim → Claimed (recipient got tokens)
             ├── silk cancel → Cancelled (sender got tokens back)
             ├── (expired) → Expired (claim window passed)
             └── (rejected) → Rejected (pool operator intervened)
```
