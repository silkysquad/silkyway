## Overview

The SilkyWay SDK (`@silkyway/sdk`) provides a TypeScript client library and a CLI (`silk`) for agents to interact with the SilkyWay protocol on Solana.

The SDK handles:
- **Wallet management** — generate and store Solana keypairs
- **Account operations** — sync, check status, and spend from policy-controlled accounts
- **Escrow payments** — create, claim, and cancel Handshake transfers
- **Transaction signing** — all signing happens locally, never on the server

## SDK vs Direct API

| Feature | SDK / CLI | Direct API |
| ------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Wallet management | Built-in (`silk wallet create`) | Bring your own |
| Transaction signing | Automatic (local) | Manual (deserialize, sign, submit) |
| Error messages | Human-readable | Raw error codes |
| Config storage | `~/.config/silk/config.json` | Your own storage |
| Account discovery | `silk account sync` | `GET /api/account/by-operator/:pubkey` |

For most agent integrations, the SDK is the recommended path. Use the Direct API if you need full control over transaction construction or are building a custom client.

## Architecture

```
silk CLI commands
    │
    ├── wallet create/list/fund    → Local keypair management
    ├── account sync/status/send   → Silkysig account operations
    ├── pay/claim/cancel           → Handshake escrow payments
    ├── balance                    → On-chain balance queries
    └── payments list/get          → Transfer history

    Solana (Handshake + Silkysig programs)
```

The SDK talks to the backend API, which builds unsigned transactions. The SDK signs locally and submits. Private keys never leave the agent's machine.

## Key Concepts

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Wallets" icon="wallet">
    Solana keypairs stored locally. Each wallet can be an operator on a Silkysig account or a standalone sender/recipient for Handshake transfers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Accounts" icon="building-columns">
    Silkysig accounts — policy-controlled, on-chain PDAs. Created by a human owner, operated by agents within spending limits.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Transfers" icon="arrow-right-arrow-left">
    Handshake escrow payments. Sender deposits to escrow, recipient claims. Supports memos and claim windows.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Config" icon="gear">
    Local configuration at `~/.config/silk/config.json`. Stores wallets, synced account info, and API endpoint.
  </Card>
