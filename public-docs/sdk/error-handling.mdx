## Error Format

When a command fails, the SDK returns a structured error with a code and message:

```
✗ REJECTED: amount $25.00 exceeds per-transaction limit of $10.00
  Error code: POLICY_EXCEEDS_TX_LIMIT
```

## Silkysig Account Errors

These errors come from the on-chain Silkysig program when operating through a policy-controlled account.

| Error Code | Meaning | Resolution |
| ---------- | ------- | ---------- |
| `POLICY_EXCEEDS_TX_LIMIT` | Transaction amount exceeds the operator's per-transaction limit | Reduce the amount or ask the account owner to increase the limit |
| `POLICY_EXCEEDS_DAILY_LIMIT` | Daily spending limit has been reached | Wait for the daily reset or ask the owner to increase the limit |
| `POLICY_UNAUTHORIZED` | The signer is not an owner or operator on this account | Run `silk account sync` to verify your wallet is an operator |
| `ACCOUNT_PAUSED` | The account has been temporarily disabled by the owner | Contact the account owner |
| `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` | Not enough tokens in the account | Check balance with `silk account status` |

## Handshake Transfer Errors

These errors come from the Handshake escrow program.

| Error Code | Meaning | Resolution |
| ---------- | ------- | ---------- |
| `TransferNotActive` | The transfer is not in `Active` status | Check transfer status with `silk payments get <pda>` |
| `InvalidTimeWindow` | Claim attempted outside the claim window | Wait until `claimable_after` or check if `claimable_until` has passed |
| `UnauthorizedClaimer` | The signer is not the designated recipient | Only the recipient can claim a transfer |
| `UnauthorizedCanceller` | The signer is not the original sender | Only the sender can cancel a transfer |
| `InsufficientFunds` | Not enough tokens to create the transfer | Check balance with `silk balance` |

## Network Errors

| Error | Meaning | Resolution |
| ----- | ------- | ---------- |
| `API_UNREACHABLE` | Cannot connect to the backend API | Check your internet connection and API URL (`silk config get-api-url`) |
| `TRANSACTION_FAILED` | Transaction was submitted but failed on-chain | Check the error details — usually a program error |
| `TIMEOUT` | Transaction confirmation timed out | The transaction may still succeed — check with `silk payments list` |

## Handling Errors in Agents

For autonomous agents, a simple pattern:

```bash
# Try the payment
silk account send <recipient> 10 --memo "payment"

# If it fails with POLICY_EXCEEDS_TX_LIMIT:
#   → Reduce amount and retry
# If it fails with INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE:
#   → Log and alert, wait for funding
# If it fails with ACCOUNT_PAUSED:
#   → Log and wait, account is temporarily disabled
# If it fails with a network error:
#   → Retry after a brief delay
```

<Warning>
  Don't retry transactions that fail with policy errors (`POLICY_EXCEEDS_TX_LIMIT`, `POLICY_EXCEEDS_DAILY_LIMIT`). These are intentional limits set by the account owner. Retrying won't change the outcome.
</Warning>

## Faucet Errors

| Error | Meaning | Resolution |
| ----- | ------- | ---------- |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | Too many faucet requests | Wait 10 minutes before requesting again |
| `DEVNET_ONLY` | Faucet only works on devnet | Switch to devnet or fund wallet manually on mainnet |
