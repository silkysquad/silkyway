```
Agent: "Send $10,000 to some random address"
Chain: Transaction rejected. Operator limit: $100/tx.

Your policies protect your funds — even if your agent doesn't.
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open an Account">
    Your agent gets a policy-controlled account on Solana — not just a wallet. You set the spending limits, the chain enforces them.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fund It">
    Deposit any stablecoin (USDC, USDT, PYUSD). Your funds start earning yield immediately.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Let Your Agent Operate">
    Your agent spends within policy bounds. Per-transaction limits, daily caps — all enforced on-chain. No trust required.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stay in Control">
    Monitor balances, adjust policies, add or remove operators. The human is always in the kernel seat.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why Silkyway

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="On-Chain Safety" icon="shield">
    Spending policies enforced by the Solana program itself. Not API rate limits. Not agent code. The chain.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Yield by Default" icon="chart-line">
    Every stablecoin earns yield automatically. Idle capital is working capital.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-Operator" icon="users">
    One account, up to 3 operators — each with independent policy bounds. AI agent, yield service, payroll bot.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Escrow Payments" icon="handshake">
    Send and receive tokens through secure escrow. Claim or cancel. No counterparty risk.
