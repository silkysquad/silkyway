# Silkyway

Secure USDC transfers on Solana. Every payment is cancellable before claim, time-lockable for approval windows, and held in on-chain custody so neither party can rug the other.

Send USDC into escrow, recipient claims it, or sender cancels for a full refund. The on-chain program handles custody — you interact through a CLI (`silk`) or HTTP API.

```
Sender Wallet → [create_transfer] → Escrow
Escrow         → [claim_transfer]  → Recipient Wallet
Escrow         → [cancel_transfer] → Sender Wallet (refund)
```

## Set up your wallet first

You need a funded wallet before you can send or receive payments. This takes three commands.

### 1. Install the CLI

```bash
npm install -g https://silkyway.ai/sdk/silkyway-sdk-0.1.0.tgz
```

### 2. Create a wallet

```bash
silk wallet create
```

This generates a Solana keypair and saves it at `~/.config/silk/config.json`. Your private key never leaves your machine.

Run `silk wallet list` to see your wallet address — you'll need it to receive payments from other agents.

### 3. Fund your wallet

On devnet, use our faucet — it gives you everything you need (0.1 SOL for transaction fees + 100 USDC for payments):

```bash
silk wallet fund
```

On other networks, you need to send SOL and USDC to your wallet address manually. SOL is required for Solana transaction fees. USDC is the token used for payments.

Check your balances anytime:

```bash
silk balance
```

You're now ready to send payments. Skip to [Send your first payment](#send-your-first-payment) or read the full CLI reference below.

## Send your first payment

```bash
silk pay 7xKXz9BpR3mFVDg2Thh3AG6sFRPqNrDJ4bHUkR8Y7vNx 10 --memo "First payment"
```

This locks 10 USDC into on-chain escrow. The recipient claims it with `silk claim <transfer-pda>`. You can cancel anytime before they claim with `silk cancel <transfer-pda>`.

## CLI Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `silk wallet create [label]` | Create a new wallet (first one is named "main") |
| `silk wallet list` | List all wallets with addresses |
| `silk wallet fund [--sol] [--usdc] [--wallet <label>]` | Fund wallet from devnet faucet |
| `silk balance [--wallet <label>]` | Show SOL and USDC balances |
| `silk pay <recipient> <amount> [--memo <text>] [--wallet <label>]` | Send USDC payment into escrow |
| `silk claim <transfer-pda> [--wallet <label>]` | Claim a received payment |
| `silk cancel <transfer-pda> [--wallet <label>]` | Cancel a sent payment |
| `silk payments list [--wallet <label>]` | List transfers |
| `silk payments get <transfer-pda>` | Get transfer details |
| `silk config set-api-url <url>` | Set the API base URL (persisted in config) |
| `silk config get-api-url` | Show the current API base URL |
| `silk config reset-api-url` | Reset API URL to default (`https://silkyway.ai`) |

Use `--wallet <label>` on any command to select a non-default wallet.

You can also set the API URL via the `SILK_API_URL` environment variable, which takes precedence over the default but not a configured value.

## End-to-End Examples

### Pay, then recipient claims

```bash
# Sender: create and fund a wallet
silk wallet create
silk wallet fund

# Sender: pay 25 USDC to a recipient
silk pay 7xKXz9BpR3mFVDg2Thh3AG6sFRPqNrDJ4bHUkR8Y7vNx 25 --memo "Payment for code review"
# → Transfer PDA: 9aE5kBqR...  (save this)

# Recipient: list incoming payments
silk payments list
# → Shows transfer with status ACTIVE

# Recipient: claim the payment
silk claim 9aE5kBqRvF3mNcXz8BpR3mFVDg2Thh3AG6sFRPqNrDJ4
# → Payment claimed, USDC deposited to wallet
```

### Pay, then sender cancels

```bash
# Sender: pay 10 USDC
silk pay 7xKXz9BpR3mFVDg2Thh3AG6sFRPqNrDJ4bHUkR8Y7vNx 10 --memo "Tentative payment"
# → Transfer PDA: 4bHUkR8Y...

# Sender: changed their mind — cancel before recipient claims
silk cancel 4bHUkR8Y7vNx3mFVDg2Thh3AG6sFRPqNrDJ4bHUkR8Y7v
# → Payment cancelled, USDC refunded to sender

# Verify it was cancelled
silk payments get 4bHUkR8Y7vNx3mFVDg2Thh3AG6sFRPqNrDJ4bHUkR8Y7v
# → status: CANCELLED
```

### Multi-wallet testing

```bash
# Create two wallets to simulate both sides
silk wallet create sender
silk wallet create receiver
silk wallet fund --wallet sender
silk wallet fund --wallet receiver

# Send from sender → receiver
silk pay $(silk wallet list | grep receiver) 5 --memo "Test" --wallet sender

# Claim as receiver
silk payments list --wallet receiver
silk claim <transfer-pda> --wallet receiver
```

## How transactions work

Silkyway is non-custodial — your private keys never leave your machine.

Every payment follows a build→sign→submit flow:

1. **Build** — Call a `POST /api/tx/*` endpoint with payment details. The backend builds an unsigned Solana transaction and returns it as base64.
2. **Sign** — The SDK signs the transaction locally using your private key (stored at `~/.config/silk/config.json`).
3. **Submit** — Send the signed transaction to `POST /api/tx/submit`. The backend forwards it to Solana and confirms it on-chain.

The backend handles Solana complexity (PDA derivation, instruction building, blockhash management) so agents don't have to. But it never sees your private key — it only builds the unsigned transaction structure. All authorization is enforced on-chain by the Solana program.

When using the CLI (`silk pay`, `silk claim`, etc.), this flow happens automatically. When using the API directly, you handle each step yourself.

## API Endpoints

Base URL: `https://silkyway.ai/api`

All requests use `Content-Type: application/json`.

### POST /api/tx/create-transfer

Build an unsigned create_transfer transaction. Locks USDC into escrow.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "sender": "BrKz4GQN1sxZWoGLbNTojp4G3JCFLRkSYk3mSRWhKsXp",
  "recipient": "7xKXz9BpR3mFVDg2Thh3AG6sFRPqNrDJ4bHUkR8Y7vNx",
  "amount": 10.00,
  "token": "usdc",
  "memo": "Payment for code review"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `sender` | string | yes | Sender's Solana public key |
| `recipient` | string | yes | Recipient's Solana public key |
| `amount` | number | yes | Amount in token units (e.g. `10.00` = 10 USDC) |
| `token` | string | yes | Token symbol (e.g. `"usdc"`) |
| `memo` | string | no | Human-readable memo |
| `claimableAfter` | number | no | Unix timestamp — recipient cannot claim before this time |

You can also pass `mint` (token mint pubkey) or `poolPda` directly instead of `token`, but `token` is the simplest option.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "transaction": "AQAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...base64...AAAAAAA=",
    "transferPda": "9aE5kBqRvF3mNcXz8BpR3mFVDg2Thh3AG6sFRPqNrDJ4",
    "nonce": "1738900000000",
    "message": "Sign and submit via POST /api/tx/submit"
  }
}
```

The `transferPda` is the on-chain address for this escrow. Save it — you need it to claim or cancel.

### POST /api/tx/claim-transfer

Build an unsigned claim_transfer transaction. Moves USDC from escrow to the recipient's wallet.

Only the designated recipient can claim. If `claimableAfter` was set, the claim will fail before that time.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "transferPda": "9aE5kBqRvF3mNcXz8BpR3mFVDg2Thh3AG6sFRPqNrDJ4",
  "claimer": "7xKXz9BpR3mFVDg2Thh3AG6sFRPqNrDJ4bHUkR8Y7vNx"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `transferPda` | string | yes | The transfer's on-chain PDA |
| `claimer` | string | yes | Recipient's Solana public key |

**Response:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "transaction": "AQAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...base64...AAAAAAA=",
    "message": "Sign and submit via POST /api/tx/submit"
  }
}
```

**Common errors:**
- `ClaimTooEarly` (6003) — `claimableAfter` hasn't passed yet
- `TransferAlreadyClaimed` (6000) — already claimed
- `TransferAlreadyCancelled` (6001) — sender cancelled first
- `Unauthorized` (6004) — claimer is not the designated recipient

### POST /api/tx/cancel-transfer

Build an unsigned cancel_transfer transaction. Refunds USDC from escrow back to the sender.

Only the original sender can cancel, and only while the transfer is still `ACTIVE` (not yet claimed).

**Request:**
```json
{
  "transferPda": "9aE5kBqRvF3mNcXz8BpR3mFVDg2Thh3AG6sFRPqNrDJ4",
  "canceller": "BrKz4GQN1sxZWoGLbNTojp4G3JCFLRkSYk3mSRWhKsXp"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `transferPda` | string | yes | The transfer's on-chain PDA |
| `canceller` | string | yes | Sender's Solana public key |

**Response:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "transaction": "AQAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...base64...AAAAAAA=",
    "message": "Sign and submit via POST /api/tx/submit"
  }
}
```

**Common errors:**
- `TransferAlreadyClaimed` (6000) — recipient already claimed
- `TransferAlreadyCancelled` (6001) — already cancelled
- `Unauthorized` (6004) — canceller is not the original sender

### POST /api/tx/submit

Submit a signed transaction to Solana.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "signedTx": "AQAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...base64-signed...AAAAAAA="
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "txid": "5UfDuXsrhFnxGZmyJxNR8z7Ee5JDFrgWHKPdTEJvoTpB3Qw8mKz4GQN1sxZWoGL"
  }
}
```

Note: `amount` is in raw token units. USDC has 6 decimals, so `"10000000"` = 10.00 USDC.

### GET /api/transfers?wallet=\<pubkey\>

      }
    ]
  }
}

## Security

- **Non-custodial** — the backend builds unsigned transactions; you sign locally with your private key before submitting
- Private keys are never transmitted to the server
- All authorization is enforced on-chain by the Solana program, not by the backend
- Keys are stored locally at `~/.config/silk/config.json` — never share this file
