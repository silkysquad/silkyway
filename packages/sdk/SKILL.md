# Silkyway Payments

Agent payments on Solana — two modes:

1. **Accounts (recommended)** — Your human creates an on-chain account, adds you as an operator with a spending limit, and funds it. You send payments directly. The on-chain program enforces your limit.
2. **Escrow transfers** — Send USDC into escrow. Recipient claims it, or you cancel for a refund.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g https://silkyway.ai/sdk/silkyway-sdk-0.1.0.tgz
```

## First-Time Setup

If you don't have a wallet configured yet:

```bash
# 1. Create your wallet
silk wallet create

# 2. Fund it with devnet SOL and USDC
silk wallet fund
```

Your wallet is saved at `~/.config/silk/config.json`. You only need to do this once.

## Escrow Transfers

If you don't have an account set up, or need to send a one-off payment with cancellation support, use escrow transfers.

### Sending a Payment

```bash
silk pay <recipient-address> <amount>
```

Example:
```bash
silk pay 7xKXz9BpR3mFVDg2Thh3AG6sFRPqNrDJ4bHUkR8Y7vNx 25 --memo "Payment for code review"
```

This sends USDC into escrow. The recipient must claim it. You'll get back a **Transfer PDA** — save this if you need to cancel later.

### Checking Your Balance

```bash
silk balance
```

### Viewing Transfers

```bash
# List active (unclaimed) transfers
silk payments list

# Get details on a specific transfer
silk payments get <transfer-pda>
```

### Claiming a Payment

If someone sent you a payment, claim it:

```bash
silk payments list
silk claim <transfer-pda>
```

### Cancelling a Payment

Cancel a payment you sent (if it hasn't been claimed yet):

```bash
silk cancel <transfer-pda>
```

## Multi-Wallet Support

Create additional wallets for testing:

```bash
silk wallet create second-wallet
silk wallet fund --wallet second-wallet
silk wallet list
```

Use `--wallet <label>` on any command to specify which wallet to use:

```bash
silk pay <address> 10 --wallet second-wallet
silk claim <transfer-pda> --wallet second-wallet
silk balance --wallet second-wallet
```

## Account Setup (Recommended)

A Silkyway account is an on-chain wallet controlled by a **human owner** who delegates spending authority to **operator agents**. Each operator has a per-transaction spending limit enforced on-chain — if you try to exceed it, the transaction is rejected by the Solana program, not the backend.

**Key concepts:**
- **Owner** — The human who creates and funds the account. Has full control (no spending limits, can pause, add/remove operators).
- **Operator** — You (the agent). Authorized to send tokens from the account, subject to a per-transaction limit set by the owner.
- **Per-transaction limit** — Maximum USDC you can send in one transaction. A limit of $5 means you can send $5 or less per transaction, as many times as you want. A limit of 0 means unlimited.
- **Pause** — The owner can pause the account, blocking all operator transfers until unpaused. You cannot unpause it.

### Setup flow

1. Create your wallet (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   silk wallet create
   ```

2. Share the setup URL with your human (replace with your address from `silk wallet list`):
   ```
   https://silk.silkyway.ai/account/setup?agent=YOUR_ADDRESS
   ```
   Your human will connect their wallet, set your spending limit, and fund the account.

3. After your human creates the account, sync it:
   ```bash
   silk account sync
   ```

4. Check your account status:
   ```bash
   silk account status
   ```

5. Send payments (policy-enforced on-chain):
   ```bash
   silk account send <recipient> <amount>
   ```

If the amount exceeds your per-transaction limit, the on-chain program rejects it with `ExceedsPerTxLimit`. If the account is paused, you'll get `AccountPaused`. If you're not an operator on the account, you'll get `Unauthorized`.

If `silk account sync` returns "No account found", your human hasn't set up the account yet — share the setup URL with them.
